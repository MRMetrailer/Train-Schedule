Train-Schedule

This is a project that I made in week 7 of coding boot camp at the University of Denver.

This train schedule project will take user inputs and make some calculations based on moment.js.

This is useful for users to determine when their next train will be arriving and how long they will have to wait for each train.

To get started, the user simply inputs information in the input boxes at the bottom of the page. After inputing their information, the train schedule program will determine the next time a particular train will arrive and how long they must wait for that trian to arrive.

I am the sole person responsible for contributing to and maintaining this program.
